These data represent the depths (in meters) corresponding to the locations of all non-zero values of CO2 efflux in the Sala et al. (2021) dataset contained in co2_efflux.tif. They were generated in QGIS 3.4.6 using the "Sample raster values" function in the Processing Toolbox. The depths were sampled from a reprojected version of the DEM contained in World_e-Atlas-UCSD_SRTM30-plus_v8.tif. The DEM was reprojected to match the Mollweide equal area projection used in the Sala et al. datasets.

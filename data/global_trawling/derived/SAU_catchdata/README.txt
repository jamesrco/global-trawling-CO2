These data on benthic trawl landings (in metric tons) were retrieved from the Sea Around Us database via the SAU API on August 25, 2022, using the script 09_ConstrainCO2Flux_getSAUdata.R. The rsearoundus package appears to have been removed from CRAN, so the functions in the script were adapted from a fork of the rsearoundus package that I found at https://github.com/robsalasco/rseaaroundus

# 04_ConstrainCO2Flux_adjFlux_EEZs.R
# Created August 4, 2022
# Purpose: Fourth in series of scripts used to constrain the estimate of
# benthic CO2 flux in Sala  et al. 2021 using the sequestration fractions in
# Siegel et al. 2021
# Author: Jamie Collins, jcollins@edf.org

# This fourth script performs the same calculations as in
# 03_ConstrainCO2Flux_adjFlux_extended.R (adjustment of the Sala et al
# benthic CO2 flux data, with time-integrated estimates of total emissions to
# the atmosphere for a variety of time horizons), but for specific
# exclusive economic zones (EEZs)

# *** Assumes user has already run 01_ConstrainCO2Flux_IO.R (in current session),
# that the object "coord.matches.RData" generated using
# 02_ConstrainCO2Flux_coordMatch.R (likely via AWS) is present in
# global-trawling-CO2/data/global_trawling/derived/output/ and that user has
# already run 03_ConstrainCO2Flux_adjFlux_extended.R, at least up to the 
# point where the functions have been defined

# set the working directory
